# Izzit_vegan

If you are vegan, it may be difficult to understand if the ingredients in your foods are actually in line with your lifestyle choices. This app is here to help

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Open Food Facts API

Open food facts is a global organization with the goal of providing open data, knowledge, tools and support for everyone to empower them to have the greatest positive impact on the food system. A user can input an EAN or UPC barcode in the search bar and which fetches data from the API. The image of the item is pulled and appedned to the left section while a tabulated list of ingredients is appended to the right section. The returned ingredients will either be labeld a white yes for vegan, a red no for not vegan, or a yellow unknown if the ingredient in the database doesn't specify. The onus is on the user to decide if the product meets their dietary restrictions


## Optimizations

As the project continues to develop, the next phase will extend the option to chose a type of dietary requirement. I would like to include the option of chosing if it is vegetarian, contains, pork, or contains gluten. 

## Lessons Learned:

Using a dataset that was not built myself can be tricky. It takes time to work through the JSON to find out exactly which type of data that I want to append to a table. It was also interesting working with tabular data. After working through this project I am now able to search and pull elements from JSON data with more efficency.
